# Design System

ForteUI is built on a comprehensive design system that ensures consistency, accessibility, and scalability across all components. Our design system is based on semantic tokens that provide meaning and context to design decisions.

## Color System

### Semantic Color Palette

ForteUI uses a semantic color system that provides clear meaning and context for different UI states and actions.

#### Primary Colors
- **Primary**: Main brand color used for primary actions and key UI elements
- **Secondary**: Supporting brand color for secondary actions and accents

#### Semantic Colors
- **Info**: Used for informational messages and neutral actions
- **Success**: Indicates successful operations and positive states
- **Warning**: Alerts users to potential issues or important information
- **Error**: Indicates errors, failures, or destructive actions

#### Neutral Colors
- **Grey Scale**: From light backgrounds to dark text, providing hierarchy and contrast

### Color Variants

Each semantic color comes with multiple variants for different use cases:

- **Main** (`-main`): The primary color value
- **Dark** (`-dark`): Darker variant for hover states and emphasis
- **Light** (`-light`): Lighter variant for subtle backgrounds
- **8% Opacity** (`-8`): Very light backgrounds and hover states
- **16% Opacity** (`-16`): Slightly more prominent backgrounds
- **48% Opacity** (`-48`): Border colors and subtle accents

## Typography

### Font Family

ForteUI uses **Plus Jakarta Sans** as its primary typeface, providing excellent readability and a modern aesthetic.

```css
font-family: 'Plus Jakarta Sans', sans-serif;
```

### Typography Scale

Our typography system uses a carefully crafted scale that ensures proper hierarchy and readability:

#### Headings
- **H1**: 32px - Page titles and major headings
- **H2**: 24px - Section headings
- **H3**: 20px - Subsection headings
- **H4**: 18px - Component titles
- **H5**: 16px - Small headings
- **H6**: 14px - Caption headings

#### Body Text
- **Body Large**: 16px - Primary body text
- **Body**: 14px - Secondary body text
- **Caption**: 12px - Small text and labels

### Font Weights

- **Light**: 300 - Subtle text elements
- **Regular**: 400 - Default body text
- **Medium**: 500 - Emphasized text
- **Bold**: 700 - Strong emphasis and headings

## Spacing System

ForteUI uses a consistent spacing scale based on 4px increments:

- **xs**: 4px
- **sm**: 8px
- **md**: 16px
- **lg**: 24px
- **xl**: 32px
- **2xl**: 48px
- **3xl**: 64px

## Component Specifications

### Button Sizes
- **Small**: 30px height
- **Medium**: 36px height (default)
- **Large**: 48px height

### Icon Button Sizes
- **Extra Small**: 28px (18px icon)
- **Small**: 36px (20px icon)
- **Medium**: 40px (24px icon)
- **Large**: 48px (32px icon)

### Border Radius
- **Small**: 4px - Small components
- **Medium**: 8px - Default components
- **Large**: 12px - Cards and containers
- **Full**: 9999px - Pills and circular elements

## Accessibility

### Color Contrast
All color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

### Focus States
Every interactive element includes visible focus indicators with proper contrast ratios for keyboard navigation.

### Semantic Meaning
Colors are never the sole means of conveying information. Icons, text, and other visual indicators provide additional context.

## Design Tokens

ForteUI's design system is built on design tokens that can be accessed programmatically:

```tsx
import { tokens } from 'forteui-tokens';

// Access color tokens
const primaryColor = tokens.colors.primary.main;
const successColor = tokens.colors.success.main;

// Access spacing tokens
const mediumSpacing = tokens.spacing.md;
```

## Using the Design System

### Custom Theming

You can customize ForteUI's design system by overriding CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --primary-main: #your-brand-color;
  --primary-dark: #your-darker-brand-color;
  /* ... other custom properties */
}
```

### Responsive Design

All components are built mobile-first and include responsive design considerations:

- **Mobile**: 0-768px
- **Tablet**: 768px-1024px
- **Desktop**: 1024px+

The design system ensures consistent spacing, typography, and layout across all breakpoints.
